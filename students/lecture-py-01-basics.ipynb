    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a set of open-source tools for interactive and exploratory computing. You work right on your browser, which becomes the user interface through which Jupyter gives you a file explorer (the _dashboard_) and a document format: the **notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook can contain: input and output of code, formatted text, images, videos, pretty math equations, and much more. The computer code is _executable_, which means that you can run the bits of code, right in the document, and get the output of that code displayed for you. This interactive way of computing, mixed with the multi-media narrative, allows you to tell a story (even to yourself) with extra powers!"

Next, we have two types of content—code and markdown—that handle a bit differently. The fact that your browser is an interface to a compute engine (called \"kernel\") leads to some extra housekeeping (like shutting down the kernel). But you'll get used to it pretty quick!"
