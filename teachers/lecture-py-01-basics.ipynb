    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook can contain: input and output of code, formatted text, images, videos, pretty math equations, and much more. The computer code is _executable_, which means that you can run the bits of code, right in the document, and get the output of that code displayed for you. This interactive way of computing, mixed with the multi-media narrative, allows you to tell a story (even to yourself) with extra powers!"

For example, most people are used to launching apps in their computers by clicking some icon: this is the first thing to \"unlearn.\" Jupyter is launched from the _command line_. Next, we have two types of content—code and markdown—that handle a bit differently. The fact that your browser is an interface to a compute engine (called \"kernel\") leads to some extra housekeeping (like shutting down the kernel). But you'll get used to it pretty quick!"
