We consider a [sample](https://github.com/gdv/foundationsCS/raw/main/students/ex-data/switrs.sqlite) of the  California Traffic Collision Dataset
(click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs/download) for the full 10GB dataset).

Determine the tables, the columns (and their meanings) and the
constraints in such database.
