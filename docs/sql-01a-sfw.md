On the customers table of the sample database [NorthWind](https://github.com/gdv/foundationsCS/raw/main/students/ex-data/Northwind/Northwind_large.sqlite) compute:


1.    The customers whose country is Italy, France or Austria.
1.    The customers whose address contains the word 'rue'.

1.    For each order, the total amount of products (quantities) sold.
1.    For each order, the total amount of products (quantities) sold and the average discount offered if non-zero. The result must be one table.
