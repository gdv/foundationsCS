Starting from the *The Movie DataBase* (TMDB) sample datasets, 

1.  For each movie, compute the number of cast members
2.  How many movies do not have a homepage?
3.  For each year, how many movies do not have a homepage?
4.  Extract the domain of each homepage.
5.  Extract a set of normalized tables. That is, each entry of a normalized table must
    contain exactly one value (not a list or a dictionary).
6.  For each movie, compute the gross margin (difference between revenue and budget)
7.  For each movie, compute the number of crew members
8.  For each movie, compute the number of directors
9.  For each language, compute the number of movies where such language is spoken.
10.  For each company and each decade, compute the overall revenue
11.  For each decade, compute the company with maximum revenue
12.  In each year, how many movies have revenue smaller than the budget?


#### Only for groups of two or three people

1.  Distribute the revenue according to the order of appearance in a movie. Assume that
    the i-th actor contributes twice as much as the (i+1)-th actor to the revenue.
1.  For each actor find the total revenue attributed to him/her.
1.  Find the actor that is responsible for the most overall revenue.

#### Only for groups of three people

1.  For each movie, compute the ratio between males and females in the cast
2.  For each movie, compute the ratio between the attributed revenue of males and females
    in the cast
3.  Find the director that has the highest average ratio computed in the previous point.
